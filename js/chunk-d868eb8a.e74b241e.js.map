Type \"!unstuck\"</h2>\n      <p>The \"!unstuck\" command will teleport your toon back to it's homepoint after 20 minutes. This command should only be used\n         as a last resprt when you're unable to move. After you type \"!unstuck\" and press enter you toon will receive a terror\n         status (your character will be unable to move or otherwise act) for 20 minutes. After a 20 minute wait your toon will be teleported back to it's home point. Anyone\n         abusing this command could be punished.

If that doesn't work ask the player to stop sending you\n          messages. If that doesn't work use the /blacklist command to block the player from contacting you in-game. If that\n          doesn't work please take a screenshot of the incident and report on discord.\n        </p>\n      <h2>Witnessed a Crime? Screenshot It</h2>\n      <p>Take a screenshot of the violation and post it in the discord channel. If you want to remain anonymous just PM me the screenshot.
