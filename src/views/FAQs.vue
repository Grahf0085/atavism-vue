          FFXI provided the impossible task to beat the Shadow Lord at level 50 by forcing groups to combine melee and magic damage dealers.
          Around the release of ROTZ the level cap was steadily raised to 75. ROTZ provided new missions and end game HNMs/Gods for the new 75
          player base to come together. The new jobs added were mostly damage dealers. COP also brought different jobs together but this time
          the challenge wasn't to be the best end game player you could be, but about how well you could master being a level 30, 40, 50, etc
          player. After COP FFXI inroduced instanced zones (salvage), made melee burn, blm burn, smn burn, and mnk burn a more normal leveling
          experience, allowed for players of all levels and all jobs to participate in events together(beseiged), and added jobs that filled
          multiple roles (to varying degrees) in a party. In short, it made the game flatter in the tradition of WoW. I say all this to point
          out why COP is different than the expansions that followed.</p>
